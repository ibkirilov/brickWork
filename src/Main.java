 * The builders must cover a rectangular area of size M × N ( M and N are even numbers)
 * with two layers of bricks that are rectangles of size 1 × 2. The first layer of the bricks has
 * already been completed. The second layer (in an effort to make the brickwork really
 * strong) must be created in a way that no brick in it lies exactly on a brick from the first
 * layer. However, it is allowed half of the same brick to lie on the same brick on the second
 * layer.
 * Create a console app that accepts input parameters for the given layout of the bricks for
 * the first layer, determine the possible layout of the second one, or prove that it is
 * impossible to create the second layer and print it in the console.
